# About
This is the source code for Unrest, a story based RPG developed by Pyrodactyl Games. 
Unrest is the third game built using my own homebrew engine named CRAB (which stands for Conversation Roleplaying Allpurpose Brawler).

I hope this helps someone out there learning to make games, or someone interested in learning how Unrest works.

# How to Compile

After cloning the repository, you will need to set a valid Boost source and lib directories in Visual Studio settings. 
For more information on how to set up Boost, visit https://www.boost.org/

# Running the Game

After successfully compiling and building the executable, you will need the game's assets. 
If you have a copy of the game, navigate to the install directory and:
1. Copy the "res" folder to the binary location
2. Copy the various DLL files to the binary location

If you're having any issues with getting the code up and running, or just want to chat about the game, feel free to contact me!
